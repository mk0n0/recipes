# Project Title
Recipe Viewer

## Project Description
I created this recipe project to illustrate what I have learned about the fundamentals of HTML thus far. It includes elements such as relative links, images, unordered lists, and ordered lists. For an added twist, I also included recipe names in either hiragana or katakana since the featured recipes are all Japanese.

Please note: I have intentionally only used HTML in this project and will later be styling it using CSS.
