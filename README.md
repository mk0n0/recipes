Recipe Viewer

## Project Description
I created this recipe project to illustrate what I have learned about the fundamentals of HTML thus far. It includes elements such as relative links, images, unordered lists, and ordered lists. For an added twist, I also included recipe names in either hiragana or katakana since the featured recipes are all Japanese.

Please note: this is an evolving project where I will continue to apply my knowledge as I learn. As of February 18, 2024 I have added basic CSS styling to the recipe pages using an external stylesheet.
